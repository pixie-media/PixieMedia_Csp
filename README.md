# PixieMedia_Csp
This module is intended as a temporary work around for when you want to use Magento_Csp (enforced) and have a payment gateway that renders on your checkout.  By default, since 3D Secure version2 there is no longer a common source URL for the card verification process.  This makes keeping your policy up to date very difficult as each bank maintains its own domains and provides no guarantee of continuity of those domains. 

Installing this module, iframes are allowed from any domain on the checkout.  This should strictly be considered a temporary work around as it clearly opens another potential security risk.

Module is provided for use at your own risk. 

Happy coding.
